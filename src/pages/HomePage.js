      <h2>I'm a programmer from Melbourne, Australia.</h2>

      <p>I work in games, specializing in UI programming. UI is fun and challenging, especially in creating interfaces that are visually engaging and easy to use. I enjoy the collaborative aspect of working with designers and artists to make something cool.<br />
        UI programming is often underestimated, but using design patterns helps in maintaining and reusing code effectively.</p>

      <p>While UI is my main role, I consider myself to be a flexible programmer who is able to to tackle problems in all areas of a codebase.</p>

      <p>At work, I use tools like C++, C#, Lua, WPF/xaml, and NoesisGUI. In my free time, I like experimenting with CSS/HTML/JavaScript, Reactjs, and working on my own game engine projects with OpenGL and C++.</p>
